# Step-4-Model-Deployment
In Step 4,I deployed my model in step 3 with Flask. During my deployment, I also applied my HTML &amp; CSS knowledge to design my API's frontend. You can find my API's local host version in ` screenshots.pdf`
* `model.pkl` points out my model that is deployed by Flask
* `temp.py` points out the temp file for Flask Deployment
* `index.html` points out the html code for the Model Deployment on Flask. It is in the `template` folder.
* `style.css` points out the CSS code for styling to my deployment. It is in the `static/ css`folder.
* `entry.png` is the png file that I used as the background image of my API.
